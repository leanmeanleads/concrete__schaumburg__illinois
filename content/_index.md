## What is mudjacking?

Mudjacking is a concrete leveling and repair process that uses a mixture of soil, and cement (called “mud”) to raise or level sunken concrete. It can also be used to fill in cracks and other minor imperfections in the surface of concrete.

The mudjacking process begins with the removal of any loose debris or vegetation from the surface of the concrete. Next, a small hole is drilled into the sunken area. The mudjacking mixture is then injected into the hole, and it flows under the slab until it reaches the high points. A consolidating agent is then added to the mixture to help it bond to the existing concrete. Finally, the hole is filled in and smoothed over.

Mudjacking is a relatively quick and easy process that can be completed in a few hours. It is also much less expensive than concrete replacement, making it a popular choice for concrete repair. Mudjacking can be used on sidewalks, and other concrete surfaces.

There are a few things to keep in mind if you are considering mudjacking for concrete repair. First, mudjacking is not a structural fix, so it will not be able to raise concrete that has sunk due to a foundation issue. Second, mudjacking is not appropriate for concrete that is severely cracked or damaged. In these cases, concrete replacement may be the only option.

If you are interested in mudjacking for concrete leveling or repair, be sure to hire a qualified contractor. Mudjacking is a specialized process, and it is important to choose a contractor who has experience and expertise in this area.

 ## Advantages and disadvantages of mudjacking

Mudjacking has a few advantages over concrete replacement. It is less expensive, and causes less disruption to your property. However, mudjacking is not a structural fix, so it cannot be used to repair concrete that has sunk due to a foundation issue.

## Hiring a contractor for mudjacking

If you are interested in mudjacking for concrete leveling or repair, be sure to hire a qualified contractor. Mudjacking is a specialized process, and it is important to choose a contractor who has experience and expertise in this area.

You can ask for referrals from friends or family, or look for contractors who are certified by the American Concrete Institute or the International Association of Foundation Drilling. Once you have a few contractors in mind, be sure to ask for quotes and compare prices. It is also a good idea to get a written contract that outlines the scope of work and the cost of the project.

## What is concrete sealer?

Concrete sealer is a type of sealant that is used to protect concrete from weathering, and other types of damage. Sealers can be applied to both new and old concrete surfaces, and they can be either clear or tinted. Most sealers are made from acrylics.

Concrete sealers provide a protective barrier against water, and other contaminants. They can also – depending on the formula – resist mildew growth, make cleaning easier, and extend the life of your concrete surfaces.

There are two primary types of concrete sealers: film-forming and penetrating. 

**Film-forming** sealers form a protective layer on the surface of the concrete. They repel water, and stains. This type of sealer can change the appearance of concrete, making it shinier or duller. Penetrating sealers penetrate into the pores of the concrete to create a barrier against water.

## When to Seal Concrete?

Most newly poured concrete surfaces should be sealed within six to 12 months after installation. The curing process – which is when excess water evaporates from the concrete – can cause damage to the surface if it’s not properly protected.

## The Pros and Cons of Concrete Sealers

Sealers can protect concrete from a variety of issues, but they also have some drawbacks.

Here are some pros and cons to consider before you decide to seal your concrete surfaces:

- Protects concrete from weathering, and other types of damage 
- Can extend the life of your concrete surfaces 
- Makes cleaning easier 
- Resists mildew growth 
- Can be applied to both new and old concrete 
- Can change the appearance of concrete 
- Requires regular maintenance 
- Can be difficult to remove 

If you’re not sure whether your concrete needs to be resealed, perform a simple test: splash some water on the surface and see how it beads up. If the water beads and rolls off, the sealer is still effective. If the water soaks in, it’s time to reapply.

## What questions do I ask a concrete contractor?

The first question you should ask any contractor is whether they are licensed and insured. This protects you in case anything goes wrong during the job. If the answer is no, move on to the next contractor.

Get a price quote. Make sure to get this in writing before you move forward with any concrete contractor. Get a feel for what their price includes and ask about any potential extras that might come up during the job so you're not surprised later on.

By asking these questions, you can be sure that you're hiring a concrete contractor that will do a great job on your project. Good luck and if you're looking for a concrete  business to work with for your project, why not come and talk to us?
